[//]: # (title: Advent of Code puzzles in Idiomatic Kotlin)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of Christmas-themed puzzles that follow an Advent calendar
and each puzzle is released daily. With the kind permission of [Eric Wastl](https://twitter.com/ericwastl), creator of Advent of Code,
we are demonstrating idiomatic Kotlin examples by solving these puzzles.

Learn idiomatic Kotlin and practice your language skills by completing short fun, tasks from the Advent of Code 2020!

### Day 3. Toboggan Trajectory

We’ll look at how to take code written in an imperative fashion and rewrite it in a more functional style. We’ll also discuss
how to work with pairs, use ‘reduce’, edit code in column selection mode, and fix integer overflows.

### Day 4. Passport processing

In the fourth episode of Idiomatic Kotlin's Advent of Code series, we will be tackling input sanitization and validation
challenges. Input sanitization and validation feels like a problem as old as programming itself. User input can’t always
be trusted, and ensuring it takes the exact form that we, as programmers expect, can take serious brain power.
We will tackle a challenge together. Stick around for an elegant solution, implemented of course in Kotlin!

### Day 5. Binary Boarding

Idiomatic Kotlin: Solving Advent of Code Puzzles, Binary Representation of Numbers
Kotlin Tutorial: Binary Representation of Numbers. Advent of Code Puzzles

In the fifth episode of Idiomatic Kotlin’s #AdventOfCode series, we'll look at a “hidden” binary encoding for natural
numbers that can be used to identify seats on a plane, along with the Kotlin solution for the challenge. Along the way,
we'll discuss the Kotlin standard library functions for working with the binary representation of numbers, the power of
local functions, and why ‘max’ disappeared from the standard library but will “reappear” in a new form.
