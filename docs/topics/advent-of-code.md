[//]: # (title: Advent of Code puzzles in idiomatic Kotlin)

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual series of Christmas-themed puzzles that follow an Advent calendar
when each puzzle is released daily. With the kind permission of [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), creator of Advent of Code,
we demonstrate how to solve these puzzles using the idiomatic Kotlin style.

> You can find all solutions for Advent of Code puzzles in the idiomatic Kotlin style in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/kotlin-hands-on/advent-of-code-2020/).
